Confluence to Xwiki covnersion tool.
This tool was written to convert a Knowledge base in Confluence to an Xwiki format. 

Essentially all this does is indexes the HTML tags, strips them, and replaces them with wiki formatting. 
It them grabs all the images on the page in the body and it stores both the reformatted text and images in the Users docmuments folder.

Still need to insert IMG and PNG links on page.
